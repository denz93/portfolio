# From Software Engineering in Vietnam to Entrepreneurial Innovation in the US

## Background

As a software engineer fresh out of university in Vietnam, I embarked on a journey that has been defined by resilience, adaptability, and innovation. Joining a startup as a Wordpress Developer, I quickly became immersed in the fast-paced environment of a small company, where versatility was key. Within two weeks, I had mastered the intricacies of the company's platform, which was built on Wordpress, and became adept at tackling any task thrown my way. In fact, I even developed a tool to streamline the development process, demonstrating my proactive approach to problem-solving.

## Unpexpected Migration

However, life took an unexpected turn when I had to relocate to the US with my family. Despite the challenges posed by my limited English proficiency, I was determined to continue my career in technology. Yet, job opportunities in the tech sector were scarce, forcing me to take on odd jobs to make ends meet. It was during this time, while working as an Amazon Flex Driver, that inspiration struck.

Observing the challenges faced by drivers in scheduling shifts, I saw an opportunity to innovate. I developed a bot, aptly named Zero Flex, to automate the shift allocation process, leveling the playing field for all drivers. The success of Zero Flex was transformative, not only providing a solution to a pressing issue but also opening my eyes to the entrepreneurial possibilities within the tech industry.

With determination and creativity, I further leveraged my skills to develop utilities that addressed everyday problems. One such innovation was a Real Estate Analysis Chrome Add-on for Zillow, designed to streamline property analysis for homebuyers and real estate professionals alike. These ventures not only showcased my technical prowess but also underscored my commitment to creating practical solutions that positively impact people's lives.

## Covid 19 - Game Changer
However, as the landscape of work shifted dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I faced new challenges. The retirement of Amazon Flex drivers rendered Zero Flex obsolete, and the competitive job market made it increasingly difficult to secure traditional employment. Yet, through it all, I have remained steadfast in my belief that adversity breeds opportunity.


## The End 

My journey has been marked by highs and lows, successes and setbacks. But through every twist and turn, I have emerged stronger and more resilient. As I navigate the ever-evolving tech industry landscape, I am fueled by the knowledge that innovation knows no bounds, and that with perseverance and ingenuity, anything is possible.
